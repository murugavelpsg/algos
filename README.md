# algos
My scratchpad for practising algorithm 

- Programmed to interfaces not the concrete implementations
- Written the basic datastructures like linked list, stack, tree, queue etc. Also used the same datastructures to solve the problems. 
- Followed Test driven development (TDD) to solve each problem. 
- Written comprehensive tests first for each problem using TESTNG before arriving at the solution. 
- On an average, the code coverage is 95% of the total lines
